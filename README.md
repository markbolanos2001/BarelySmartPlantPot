# BarelySmartPlantPot
This project is super simple and is just for fun really , i like plants , but im bad at taking care of them , so having a pico tell me when to water is ideal for me.


## How does this work?
This current version simply uses a pico , a soil sensor and a single rgb led to read the moisture of the soil , then set the led to a certain colour (red == dry, etc..). There are also 3d files for the plant pot itself as i wanted the pot to be printed out.
